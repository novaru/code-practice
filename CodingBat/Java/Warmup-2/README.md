### stringTimes
- Description:
Given a string and a non-negative int n, return a larger string that is n copies of the original string.
- Solution:

---
### frontTimes
- Description:
Given a string and a non-negative int n, we'll say that the front of the string is the first 3 chars, or whatever is there if the string is less than length 3. Return n copies of the front;
- Solution:

---
### countXX
- Description:
Count the number of "xx" in the given string. We'll say that overlapping is allowed, so "xxx" contains 2 "xx".
- Solution:

---
### doubleX
- Description:
Given a string, return true if the first instance of "x" in the string is immediately followed by another "x".
- Solution:

---
### stringBits
- Description:
Given a string, return a new string made of every other char starting with the first, so "Hello" yields "Hlo".
- Solution:

---
### stringSplosion
- Description:
Given a non-empty string like "Code" return a string like "CCoCodCode".
- Solution:

---
### last2
- Description:
Given a string, return the count of the number of times that a substring length 2 appears in the string and also as the last 2 chars of the string, so "hixxxhi" yields 1 (we won't count the end substring).
- Solution:

---
### arrayCount9
- Description:
Given an array of ints, return the number of 9's in the array.
- Solution:

---
### arrayFront9
- Description:
Given an array of ints, return true if one of the first 4 elements in the array is a 9. The array length may be less than 4.
- Solution:

---
### array123
- Description:
Given an array of ints, return true if the sequence of numbers 1, 2, 3 appears in the array somewhere.
- Solution:

---
### stringMatch
- Description:
Given 2 strings, a and b, return the number of the positions where they contain the same length 2 substring. So "xxcaazz" and "xxbaaz" yields 3, since the "xx", "aa", and "az" substrings appear in the same place in both strings.
- Solution:

---
### stringX
- Description:
Given a string, return a version where all the "x" have been removed. Except an "x" at the very start or end should not be removed.
- Solution:

---
### altPairs
- Description:
Given a string, return a string made of the chars at indexes 0,1, 4,5, 8,9 ... so "kittens" yields "kien".
- Solution:

### stringYak
- Description:
Suppose the string "yak" is unlucky. Given a string, return a version where all the "yak" are removed, but the "a" can be any char. The "yak" strings will not overlap.
- Solution:

---
### array667
- Description:
Given an array of ints, return the number of times that two 6's are next to each other in the array. Also count instances where the second "6" is actually a 7.
- Solution:

---
### noTriples
- Description:
Given an array of ints, we'll say that a triple is a value appearing 3 times in a row in the array. Return true if the array does not contain any triples.
- Solution:

---
### has271
- Description:
Given an array of ints, return true if it contains a 2, 7, 1 pattern: a value, followed by the value plus 5, followed by the value minus 1. Additionally the 271 counts even if the "1" differs by 2 or less from the correct value.
- Solution:
