- Solution

## near_hundred

Given an int n, return True if it is within 10 of 100 or 200. Note: `abs(num) `computes the absolute value of a number.
- Solution

## pos_neg

## not_string

Given a string, return a new string where "not " has been added to the front. However, if the string already begins with "not", return the string unchanged.
- Solution

## missing_char
- description

Given a non-empty string and an int n, return a new string where the char at index n has been removed. The value of n will be a valid index of a char in the original string (i.e. n will be in the range `0..len(str)-1` inclusive).
- Solution

## front_back
- description

Given a string, return a new string where the first and last chars have been exchanged.
- Solution

## front3

Given a string, we'll say that the front is the first 3 chars of the string. If the string length is less than 3, the front is whatever is there. Return a new string which is 3 copies of the front.
